Two important notebooks : 
LCARS-LCA-LDA.ipynb : Contains all the code implementing the LCA-LDA model, it includes experimental result
LCARS-Data-Collection.ipynb : Contains all the code for the generation of the data set.

I am working on an another version of the model that does not take into consideration content information of saptial items : Location-Aware LDA (LA-LDA)

I plan to test the model on DoubanEvent data set, that contains content informations.
